1 What is TensorFlow 2.0, and how is it different from TensorFlow 1.x2 ?
ans 
TensorFlow is a framework that gives functionality to perform various deep learning approches.
    i-That can be image classification through cnn,rcnn etc
    ii- That can be NLP task's using RNN Lstm etc

in TensorFlow 2.0 there is no redundant api along with existing apis are more consistant rather than 1.x2 
version

2 How do you install TensorFlow 2.02?
ans 
for installing TensorFlow latest version 
go to the comand promt
type 
-> pip install TensorFlow

3 What is the primary function of the tf.function in TensorFlow 2.02 ?
ans 
tf.function is a decorater provided by TensorFlow
adding two list's , tupple , constant with simple function can difficult according to computation
but adding decorater to that function the parameter can convert into tensor and output also convert to 
a tensor which is efficent to perform .

4 What is the purpose of the Model class in TensorFlow 2.0 ?
ans 
model class in TensorFlow gives structure of the model(basicly input to model and output to model)
whether it sequential or input-output combination or pre-existing model.

5 How do you create a neural network using TensorFlow 2.0?
ans
first selct the component's that require for create the model.
then make a object of model.Sequential()
inside the parenthesis you can write the comma separated component which are from (keras.layers) along 
with parameter inside squre braket.

6 What is the importance of Tensor Space in TensorFlow ?
ans 
Tensor's are multi-dimentional uniform  immutable vector's .
By converting our data to a tensor it can efficently to manupulating our  data and it is easyer to 
apply machine learning algorithm on it to find complex pattern behind it.

7 How can TensorBoard be integrated with TensorFlow 2.0 ?
ans
When a model is training on a custom dataset then it is important to measure the accuracy , loss for each 
epoch (for better training ) visualize the model training.
so TensorBoard provides some special functionality that measuer's above thing


8 What is the purpose of TensorFlow Playground2 ?
ans
TensorFlow Playground2 is a website where you can visualize your model what ever you want to 
perform (that can be classification , regression ).
simple you add these component what you use to be in your model (layers and nurons ).
see the flow diagram it will show you the actual flow of training.


9 What is Netron, and how is it useful for deep learning models ?
ans 
Netron is a nural network model visualization tool developed based on the Electron platform.
It support's the visualization of many mainstream AI framework models.

10  What is the difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch  ? 
ans
PyTorch offer's dynamic computational graphs , allowing on the flay modification during 
training .This makes it ideal for project's  requring adaptable architecture.
while TensorFlow uesd as industrial purpose. It offer's static computatinal graphs.


11 How do you install PyTorch ?
ans 
pip install torch

12 What is the basic structure of a PyTorch neural network ?
ans
nural network consis of layers and modules that perform operation on data.
The torch.nn namespace povides all the building block's that you need to buikd your own nural network.
Every comonet of pytorch is a subclass of nn.Module.


13 What is the significance of tensors in PyTorch ?
ans
pytorch Tensor's are multi-dimentional uniform  immutable vector's .
By converting our data to a tensor it can efficently to manupulating our  data and it is easyer to 
apply machine learning algorithm on it to find complex pattern behind it.

14 What is the difference between torch.Tensor and torch.cuda.Tensor in PyTorch ?
ans
if we create a tensor using torch.Tensor then it accupy memory in cpu of computer and no nvidea graphis card 
is require for torch.Tensor but if we use the torch.cuda.Tensor then it occupy memory in GPU . It is faster
rather than torch.cuda.Tensor .it works paralley to perform task's.

15 What is the purpose of the torch.optim module in PyTorch ?
ans
torch.optim give following.
    i Automate Parameter Updates
    ii Provide Various Optimization Algorithms
    iii Support for Advanced Techniques


16 What are some common activation functions used in neural networks?
ans
    i relu
    ii sigmoid
    iii lekyrelu

17 What is the difference between torch.nn.Module and torch.nn.Sequential in PyTorch ?
ans
torch.nn.Module is the base class for all neural network models in PyTorch, allowing for flexible
 model definitions with custom forward methods.
torch.nn.Sequential is a subclass of torch.nn.Module that stacks layers in a sequential order,
 automatically defining the forward pass without custom logic.
Use torch.nn.Module for complex architectures with shared layers,
 multiple inputs/outputs, or conditional logic. Use torch.nn.Sequential for simple, linear stack models.


18 How can you monitor training progress in TensorFlow 2.0 ?
ans 
using callback in TensorFlow at the model.fit(callback =  callback) we can moniter our training process.

19 How does the Keras API fit into TensorFlow 2.0 ?
ans 
using
from tensorflow import keras


20 What is an example of a deep learning project that can be implemented using TensorFlow 2.0 ?
ans 
text to image 


21 What is the main advantage of using pre-trained models in TensorFlow and PyTorch?
ans
the main advantage of these that we need not fine tune further if 
we using pretrained model.
